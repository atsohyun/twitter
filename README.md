## Twitter

In 2014-2015, I carried out two Twitter-related projects, where I mainly took the role of analyzing Twitter messages ("tweets") to discover the source of the information included and the influence of media circulated in tweets. Please refer to the papers in each folder, [cancer](https://github.com/atsohyun/twitter/tree/master/cancer) and [media](https://github.com/atsohyun/twitter/tree/master/media) for more information!

### Cancer-related Information in Twitter
In this study, we collected 70000+ tweets containing one or more colon cancer-related terms. Applying a naive Bayesian classifier, we classified each tweet being "informative" and "communicative." Among the informative tweets, we further investigated the source of the information and analyzed the credibility of the information with 5 medical professionals at [Seoul National University Bundang Hospital](https://www.snubh.org). Our findings indicate that though there may be credible information being circulated in tweets, caution needs to be paid for the untrained eye. Find out more about our work in the papers! 

### Media Influence in Twitter
The rise of social media has changed the landscape of people subscribing to news and voicing public opinion. It is necessary to investigate what media play a role in on- and off-line public discussion. Our team took part in analyzing the online influence of media in a popular social networking platform that is Twitter. We collected 7m+ tweets containing external URLs for news tweets, and retracked their source. Our findings indicate that most grassroots media find social media a convenient platform to endorse their contents. Moreover, most users subscribe to news via giant portal services (i.e. [daumkakao](www.daum.net) and [Naver](www.naver.com)). Read the official government report for more information!
